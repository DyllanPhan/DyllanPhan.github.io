### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

Lab 5 part 3 was one of my favorites because I love blackjack, and this project brought back memories of my friends and me. So coding this gave me the opportunity to write a program that computes the score for a hand of blackjack using command line arguments. And printing outputs that say score or bust made the game feel real to me. Given those reasons, this project was one of my favorites. It also helped me learn/ strengthen the use of if/else if statements.

* Lab 11

Another of one my favorites is Lab 11 part 1. This one was one of my favorites as it was complicated for me and was honestly one of the hardest labs that I have done so far. Having to create a vector of State objects, while having each state represents one state of the USA and having to Loop the states was one of the hardest challenges for me and overcoming that to finish the project made it one of my favorites.

* Lab 12

One of my favorites is Lab 12 part 1 because it was the first animated project that I have done and thought that it was really fascinating how to construct the project. Like by By combining the three channels together and combining the images to make a GIF. And adding a concept that I have never used before like the SineLookUpTable to then create a double.
